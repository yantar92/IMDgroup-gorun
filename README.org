* IMDgroup-gorun

This is a set of scripts for supercomputer job submission for VASP and
ATAT via [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/][slurm]], that are tailored to research that is performed in
[[https://www.oimalyi.org/][Inverse Materials Design group]].

* Installation

#+begin_src bash
  # Download the package and source dependencies
  git clone https://git.sr.ht/~yantar92/IMDgroup-gorun

  # Activate virtual environment
  pip -m venv .venv
  . .venv/bin/activate

  # Install into the environment
  pip install IMDgroup-gorun
#+end_src

* Features

- Submit slurm jobs in a single unified command, consistent across
  different supercomputers (specific per-cluster configuration is
  configured separately)
- Automatically detect the most suitable queue (experimental)
- Make sure that the VASP input to be submitted is sane
  - Check for any issues in ICNAR/POSCAR and automatically resolve (when safe)
  - Check if VASP calcualtion is already converged
- If an existing VASP output is present, automatically back it up
  and restart the VASP, using the results of the previous calculation
- Automatically generate POTCAR file
- Automatically setup vdW kernel
- Submit ATAT jobs in a single unified command
  - Customize individual VASP runs invoked by ATAT
